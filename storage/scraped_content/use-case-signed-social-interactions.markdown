### Use Case: Signed Social Interactions to Space and Time Tables

One advanced use case enabled by Space and Time is a decentralized social media application where every user interaction has financial implications—such as each post creating a token, and every “like” simultaneously triggering a retweet and a token purchase. In this model, users are abstracted away from wallet management, yet the backend must still enforce correctness, verifiability, and scalability without relying on centralized infrastructure. This presents challenges around user approvals, gas fees, and trustless state computation—challenges directly addressed by the SXT architecture.

Using Space and Time, each user “like” can be represented as a gasless, signed insert into a verifiable table (e.g., likes\_table). These signatures (EDDSA or ED25519) are verified upon submission and stored off-chain with cryptographic commitments updated on-chain by SXT validator nodes. The schema would include columns like user\_id, post\_id, token\_id, price\_paid, and timestamp. A smart contract can later query this table—via ZK-proven SQL queries—to compute token balances and profit/loss for each user. The user then calls a single on-chain claim function that verifies the ZK proof and disburses the computed outcome without requiring gas-intensive per-like transactions.

To avoid requiring a user signature on every like, developers can integrate account abstraction (e.g., via ERC-4337 smart wallets). A user might sign a single session approval (e.g., allowing up to 100 likes with a $1 cap per like), and the backend would execute future likes within that approved window. Automated token selling can be handled via predefined smart contract rules (e.g., bonding curves or volatility triggers), and a periodic settlement contract allows users to claim their consolidated earnings or token positions.

Space and Time’s architecture is essential here: the SQL query logic (e.g., token balances per user) is executed off-chain with GPU acceleration and proven using the Proof of SQL protocol. The resulting ZK proof and output are submitted to the on-chain contract for verification, ensuring complete trustlessness. This model enables massive interaction throughput (millions of likes per day) without bloating the EVM, while preserving verifiable economic guarantees—an essential feature for any decentralized, tokenized social media system.
