Before the launch of Space and Time, no verifiable database existed for EVM smart contracts. While traditional applications rely on databases to personalize and execute logic based on historical user interactions, smart contracts in the EVM lacked a trustworthy equivalent. Developers could index past blockchain events into a traditional off-chain database, but no method existed to verify—onchain—that those databases hadn't been manipulated. This created a fundamental trust issue between decentralized application logic and the data those apps depended on.

Consider the case of a liquid staking protocol that rebalances token shares daily based on transfer activity. If the rebasing logic relies on SQL queries against a mutable off-chain database, a malicious actor with write access could alter a single row and mint millions in fraudulent rewards. Even if a decentralized oracle delivers the result to the contract, the integrity of the original data source remains unverified. The same risk applies to airdrops based on user history, or lending protocols adjusting borrow rates based on claimed loan performance. Any data-driven contract behavior becomes a liability without a tamperproof guarantee that the query result is correct and reflects real user actions.

SXT Chain addresses this gap by acting as the first verifiable database layer for the EVM. Its core architecture transforms raw onchain data—such as events and transactions—into relational tables indexed redundantly (with BFT consensus) off-chain by decentralized indexers. These tables are not stored directly onchain but are instead secured via cryptographic commitments (e.g., Dory, HyperKZG). When a smart contract issues a SQL query, a Prover node executes the query off-chain, generates a zero-knowledge proof (Proof of SQL), and submits both the result and the proof to the contract. The smart contract verifies the proof without ever trusting the raw data or external systems.

This system ensures that the SQL query results—and the underlying tables from which they are derived—are cryptographically tamperproof and can be validated trustlessly onchain. Developers gain access to fast, complex, and historical data queries with sub-second ZK proofs, while retaining full trustlessness of their smart contract logic. In effect, Space and Time extends the EVM to include database-backed applications without compromising security or decentralization.
